# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PokeSim

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Text based catching pokemon

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I would like to make a program that lets you pick an area in Pokemon Red/Blue, and will generate a random encounter with a Pokemon. This simulates the wild Pokemon encounters that are a staple of the franchise. The program will use standard random number generation, with certain numbers correlating to certain Pokemon encounters. I would also like to include a catching mechanic if i have the time.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Allowing the user to pick a location and generating random Pokemon encounters from that location (each location offers different pokemon/encounter rates)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

including a catching mechanic that lets you weaken and attempt to catch the pokemon like in the games

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

keep a history of the pokemon that you've caught, making the actual catching more game accurate (i.e. multiple pokeball types, each pokemon has a diff catch rate)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
First I will implement the different areas and what pokemon are in each, their encounter rates, and the actual encounter using random number generation. I will need to learn how to assign certain pokemon encounter "pools" to different areas in order to make the encounters game accurate. I will need to learn more about storing/recalling data, especially if I want to reach my ultimate goal of having the user be able to catch and have a history of caught pokemon.
